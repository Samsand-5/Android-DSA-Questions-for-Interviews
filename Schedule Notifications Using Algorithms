You need to schedule notifications for a user’s reminders in a way that notifications don’t overlap. Given a list of reminder times,
write an algorithm to determine if they can be scheduled without conflict.


data class Reminder(val start: Int, val end: Int)

fun canSchedule(reminders: List<Reminder>): Boolean {
    val sortedReminders = reminders.sortedBy { it.start }
    for (i in 1 until sortedReminders.size) {
        if (sortedReminders[i].start < sortedReminders[i - 1].end) {
            return false // Overlap detected
        }
    }
    return true
}

fun main() {
    val reminders = listOf(Reminder(1, 3), Reminder(2, 5), Reminder(6, 8))
    println(canSchedule(reminders)) // Output: false (due to overlap between 1-3 and 2-5)
}

Sort the reminders by start time and check for overlaps using intervals.
